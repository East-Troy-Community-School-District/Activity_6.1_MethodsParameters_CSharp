 * Instructions:
 * For this program, let's write three methods.
 * 1. Write a method that displays a 3x3 square made of
 *    asterisks (*) to the console. Call your method
 *    in the Main() method to check that it works.
 * 2. Write a method that displays a 3x3 right triangle 
 *    that is left aligned and made of asterisks (*)
 *    Again, call your method in the Main() method to 
 *    check that it works. It should display...
 *    *
 *    * *
 *    * * *
 *    
 * 3. Finally, Write a method that displays a 3x3 right triangle 
 *    that is right aligned and made of asterisks (*)
 *    Again, call your method in the Main() method to 
 *    check that it works. It should display...
 *        *
 *      * *
 *    * * *
 *    
 * After writing the methods, Mr. Pawelski will show you how
 * to write XML comments, which we will discuss at the end
 * of the lesson.
